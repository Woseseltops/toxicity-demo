<h1>Toxic player simulation</h1>
<p>Multiple online battle arena (MOBA) is a genre in videogames that is currently very popular: both DOTA2 by Valve and League of Legends by Riot Games report many millions of unique players per month. The genre however has severe problems with so-called 'toxic players'. These players deliberately insult or harass teammates and/or opponents, thereby ruining the game for all other players. We study the linguistic behaviour of these toxic players.</p>
<p>This webdemo follows from that study; we simulate what the average normal versus the average toxic player would respond to chat messages.
    It was trained on tribunal data from the game League of Legends. We would also like to include data from other games, like DOTA2.</p>
<p>Suggestions: 'we won', 'u suck', 'excuse me', 'stop it', 'SHUT UP', 'i call bullshit', 'kill him!'</p>
