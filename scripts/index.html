<h1>Toxix player simulation</h1>
<p>Multiple online battle arena (MOBA) is a genre in videogames that has serious problems with so-called 'toxic players'.
    These players misbehave both in game and on the ingame chat, for example by offending teammates. We study the linguistic
    behaviour of these toxic players.</p>
<p>This webdemo follows from that study; we simulate what the average normal versus the average toxic player would say.
    It was trained on tribunal data from the game Leaguage of Legends by developer Riot Games. We would also like to include data
    from the game DOTA2 by developer Valve.</p>
